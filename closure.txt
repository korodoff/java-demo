what are closures?
Closures: When a fun is running , there is a another variable , we may access the local variable .........
It is a combination of inner function and the lexical environment that was created by the inner function.
We are able to access the variable inside the function becoz of closures.

function outer(){
  let a =10;
  function inner() {
     console.log(a);
  }
  inner();
}
outer();
