1. Function Constructors:


1. Func const are use for creating objects in js.
2. We can call the constructor directly.
3. constructor name should starts with Caps.
4. function Name(){
.............}
 var march = new Function()
   Function( arg1, ar2, ....){
     name : "";
     class : " ";
   }
5.when we call the constructor , it will create an object.
6.dont have any return stmt.
7. Any varibale which gets created by using any constructor fun. 
Then that variable will persists the properties that constructor function provides.
var march = new Function()
8. Adding property to constructor using prototype.


2.what is hoisting?


1.using the variable or fun before defining it.
2.calling the func before declaring.
3. let and const doesnot support hoisting.(TDZ)
4.var support hoisting, hoisting happen at the top of code.
5.it will get memory located.
6. whenever we call var , fun we need to initailaise them in before call.


3.What is the DOM?


HTML is used to structure the web pages and Javascript is used to add behavior 
to our web pages. When an HTML file is loaded into the browser, the javascript 
can not understand the HTML document directly. So, a corresponding document is 
created(DOM)(Documentary Object Model) DOM is basically the representation of the 
same HTML document but in a different format with the use of objects. 
Javascript interprets DOM easily i.e javascript can not understand the tags(<h1>H</h1>)
 in HTML document but can understand object h1 in DOM. Now, Javascript can access 
each of the objects (h1, p, etc) by using different functions.



4. Difference between undefined vs not defined vs NaN.


undefined: variable is defined,but in memorey creation phase, it will take undefined.
  let marks =50;
not defined: varibale which is not present in either global or local scope.
NaN: Not a Number,
let marks ="50"


5.How many operators do we have in JS ?

Operators: 
1.It will use to compare the value , adding the value.
Airthmatic: +,-,*,/,% 
Comparison Operators : it always returns you the boolean values(true or false)  ==, ===, 
 < ,> , <= ,>= ,!=, !==

!= returns when values are not equal , just check the values only.
!== return when values are not equal and check the value , datatype.
 
Increament/Decrement:::a++, ++a, a--, --a,
++a  => 1+a ; first value gets incremeented, then var get printed.
a--  => a = a-1;
--a  => 1-a;
Logical Operators: && , ||, !.
Mathematical Reasoning:
<failure o/p>
a>>>b
